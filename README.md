Popular Movies Android App 

MovieManiac is the final project app for the Udacity course Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals.

The app requests data from themoviedb.org using an API in the MovieSyncAdapter class. The API key for this app has been removed. If you wish to run the code, you can request your own API key from www.themoviedb.org.
